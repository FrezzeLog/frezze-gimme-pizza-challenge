	* Special request / Client observation (send me a message when you arrive, exchange black olive for green ones, etc)
	* Delivery address
2. Create basic clientele registration (Full Name, Contacts, Address, ID)
3. Allow delivery address to be customizable (different from the registered client address)
	* Scheduled Order (Mon~Sat, from 6PM to 12AM with a 2H window)

5. Create Order workflow (suggested statuses: OPEN, CONTACT CLIENT, PREPARING, OUT FOR DELIVERY, CANCELED, DONE)
	* Allow Order configuration by the system owner in OPEN and CONTACT CLIENT statuses
6. Provide list and bucket views (by status) of Orders (consider pagination)

## What guidelines do I need to follow? ##

1. There are no restrictions regarding any frontend or backend development frameworks used in this project
	* Feel free to choose the stack that most suits you. Yet, it's important for you to know that Frezze's applicatons are currently developed in Angular + Spring Boot
2. The source code must be available through a public project in any Git repository hosting service of your preference
3. The provided repository must contain a README with a brief explanation about the project and with the steps in order to run the project successfully
	* Include any details if needed
	* Docker images are welcome
4. Both application (frontend and backend) must be accessible through the cloud
	* You may use any cloud service of your preference (Firebase, Heroku, DO, AWS, etc)
5. For the evaluation process, we will consider the following:
	* Developed features
	* Applied principles regarding frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, JS)
	* Clean code and code maintainability
	* Best practices
	* Componentization
	* Developed tests
	* Frontend application design
	* Applied concepts in the backend development (be it a REST or GraphQL API)
